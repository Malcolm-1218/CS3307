Restaurant order system
The project is to design a food ordering system for customers to order 
food from offline restaurants (brick and mortar). Customers use this system to perform 
four functions: create an order, call the waiter, remind to deliver the food, and make 
payment. The project aims to enable fast communication with waiters and meals, to 
improve the efficiency of restaurant service, and to avoid unnecessary waiting for 
customers.
